## Machine Learning Intern @ Mila
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*

During this research / machine learning internship at Mila. I worked under Professor Bang Liu's NLP Lab.

We were building a personal assistant for researchers. It would be designed to access your local files as well as popular foundational models. You can also tailor it for your research (like a custom GPT-ish).
I was mainly in charge of researching efficient graph evaluation methods for our LLM-agents. So a lot of RAG, prompt-engineering, and tinkering with different huggingface APIs to optimize storage queries.

I also started the app development. We chose Tauri (a highkey better version of Electron).
Wrote some code to route backend APIs (huggingface, WeaviateDB, ReactJS).

## Software Developer Intern @ [Ensemble AI](https://www.tryensemble.com/)
*Jan 2024 – May 2024*

Worked in a small team under a McGill StartUp Incubator called the Kernel.
We built a AI-platforming tool for Real-Estate Agents.

Learned a lot on unit testing, building react components, and microservices like AWS (Textract, Elastic BeanStalk, EC2).
I also learned Docker and Kubernetes for the first time.

At the end we, the Kernel Team partenered up with Ensemble, a Montreal-based Startup.
Technology got acquired by Ensemble (still ongoing development).
