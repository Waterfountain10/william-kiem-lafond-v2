Hey, I am William. I'm a Computer Science and Statistics student at McGill University. I am based in Montreal, Canada. I like coding backend in Java or Go (and ML in Python).

I'm currently maintaining a CGPA of 3.88/4.00 while studying Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented/Functional Programming, Software Systems, and Intro Data Science.
