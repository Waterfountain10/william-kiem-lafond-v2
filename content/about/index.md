Hey, I am William. I'm a Computer Science and Statistics student at McGill University.

I am based in Montreal, Canada. I speak French and English fluently with an intermediate level Korean.
My main interests are Machine Learning, Algorithms & Data Structures, and Distributed Systems.

I write mostly backend code in Go, Java, and Python.

I love to watch k-dramas.
