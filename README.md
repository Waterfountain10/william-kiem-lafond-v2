# welcome to my personal site v2

I will mostly write down all my projects and experience as a coder, writer, researcher, etc. 
For projects, I will try to put down most of my thought process.
And as for my internships, I hope it gets filled by the time someone reads it...


Built entirely in Go's framework Hugo. 

Inspired by Notion's Theme.
